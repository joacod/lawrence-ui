# Testing Rules for Lawrence UI
- Testing guidance is for reference; do not prioritize unless asked
- Write unit tests for components and services when requested
- Aim for high test coverage on critical logic if testing is requested
- Place tests in src/test/ directory
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
