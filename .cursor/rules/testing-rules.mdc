# Testing Rules for Lawrence UI
- Testing guidance is for reference; do not prioritize unless asked
- Do not automatically generate tests, only create tests when explicitly requested by the user
- Use Vitest as the primary test runner
- Use @testing-library/preact for component testing
- Use jsdom as the test environment for UI tests
- Write unit tests for components and services when requested
- Aim for high test coverage on critical logic if testing is requested
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
